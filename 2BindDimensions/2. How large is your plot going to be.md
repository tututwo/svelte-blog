# How large is your plot going to be?

In the last tuttorial, we learned how to import data. With data in our hands, where are we going to plot them?

The more realistic question could even come first: How large should this "place" before we create it? Should it be the same size of my phone or my laptop?

## 							Get Dynamic Dimension: offsetWidth/Height

Let's do a simple one. Go to the [example](https://svelte.dev/repl/a63b1d9ae45f487eb77fb2ce00946efc?version=3.38.2) and take a look at *App.svelte* and *Trial.svelte*. 

There is one <h1>element in the DOM. It looks large, or at least, wide. Can we know the exact width of it? 

Here comes the magical offsetWidth property:

```javascript
console.log(document.querySelector('h1').offsetWidth)
```

We are basically saying: hey <h1>, tell me your width now. If you are checking the console on your laptop, you will see the current width of <h1>. A smaller number will show up if you are looking at the console on your phone/iPad. **It's all based on your device size**. Isn't that amazing?(For more detailed information about offsetWidth, please refer to [MDN document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/offsetWidth) and [this StackOverFlow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21064101/understanding-offsetwidth-clientwidth-scrollwidth-and-height-respectively)) 

**Be careful**: offsetWidth is an **HTML** element property. Not SVG. Not SVG. Not SVG.

### console.log in onMount

Another problem you must have now if you have been following my code is:

Ok. I will give you a quick answer: put console.log inside onMount function

```javascript
onMount(() => {
  const element = document.querySelector('h1')
  console.log(element.offsetWidth)
})
```

Why? This has a lot to do with Svelte's unique updating pattern. Feel free to read ***this article*** to know more about Svelte's workflow.

Here is what happens: When you just console.log at top-level (just in <script> but not inside anything in <script>), <h1> is not in the DOM yet. That is why document.querySelector('h1') returns null. 

Hence, you put console.log inside onMount: do this(log offsetWidth) once all components are mounted(aka, added to the DOM). 

If you uncomment the code chunk amid Trail.svelte, I got 756, the width of <h1> element on my screen. You will get something too based on your device screen size. 

## 												Set Dynamic Dimension: bind

Now we can get the dynamic width of any HTML element.

Here is what we do: get the width from some element, assign it to our svg element' width, and then do some chart work!

Wait...which HTML element's width are we getting? We are plotting inside SVG element right? but we can't retrieve <svg> element's width directly...Ahh 

```html
<div class = "chart-container">
  <svg></svg>
</div>
```

Just put <svg> inside a <div> element, and repeat what we did in the last section. Refer to *Child_trial.svelte* component to see the code.

Since we are using Svelte, we'd better do this in a Svelte way. Refer to the [tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/dimensions) for better instructions.

My interpretation for bind:

```html
<div class = "chart-container"
     bind:some_property = {variable}>  
  <!-- variable = some_property -->
</div>
```

 bind:some_property = {variable}

"As an HTML element, I(div) have some property. Bind takes it and assigns the value to some variable"

It is nice to set up width and height for our chart container, what if we also want some customization? offsetWidth/Height are readOnly properties, meaning we can't change them. Does that mean we can't ever change any dimensions of our chart container at all?

### Use some CSS help

Have you ever wondered why <div> has such width and height?(549 and 153 pixels in my case)

Because <div> has its default css property: display: block; height: auto.

If we change <div>'s property, then we will get different values from binding.

```css
<style>
	.chart-container {
		height:100%;
		width: 50%
	}
</style>
```

Add this to the component.

It is saying: make this element's height 100% of its parent's height, its width 50% of its parent's width 

If you toggle to change the screen size now, you will see different [width, height] array are logged in the console.
