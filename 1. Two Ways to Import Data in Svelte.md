# Svelte Data Viz Study Notes 1: Three Ways to Import Data in Svelte 

The series is not going to be a comprehensive introduction to D3.js or Svelte.js, but will share my personal experience of creating data visualizations using Svelte+d3.

The API documentation is [intimidatingly huge](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md), but there is a subset of it that lays a crucial foundation for reading and writing programs that use d3. My intention here is to communicate those foundations in a way that I would have liked to have had them communicated to me when I was starting out, and have you using it confidently rather than hesitantly.

My intention here is to expose my learning experience as a reference so as to lay a foundation for **you** to facilitate your work in a Svelte data visualization environment. (I was so eager to see such examples when I was starting out) 

Feel free to shoot me questions or correct me if you find me wrong since I am still a learner and always making mistakes.

**Today I will show you how to import data in Svelte. **

Let's do this!

## Easiest Way: Use Import ... from "path"

Let's start with the easiest way. 

1. **Code below is all you need.**

   ```javascript
   import data from "./data.csv"   // this could be from any path of the desired data file
   
   console.log(data)
   ```

   **BUT** Svelte doesn't just happily handle csv for you.

   It needs a plugin, called [**@rollup/plugin-dsv**](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/dsv)

2. **Go to the current project folder(not src, not public, just the primary folder where you store everything) and type the command below in the  terminal**

   ```javascript
   npm install @rollup/plugin-dsv --save-dev
   ```

   Now, Svelte gets its plugin. The last thing you need to do is to make sure Svelte uses it.

   Inside *rollup.config.js*, there is a **plugins:[]** property. 

3. **Add dsv() to to it.**

***Tips:*** 

When you use this method to import data:

* You need to have the data locally
* Do not put data inside public folder. (In this way, path of data will be "data.csv") Imports is found differently than the way svelte serves other public assets. Your import is gonna be bundled with your app so it needs to be in the src folder

## Retro-way: d3.csv().then()

First of all, import d3 in Svelte. (Do this however you want, I used **npm install d3**)

Then you can get the d3.csv(or d3.json, d3.tsv whichever you want) from d3.js

```javascript
import { csv } from "d3" // I just want the csv function
```

Now things may become familiar.

```javascript
let dataset = []
csv("./data/teachers.csv", function(data){
		return data
	}).then(data => {
		dataset = data
  			// you can also mutate data here
  			// .map((d,i) => ({...d, keyed: i}))
        // .filter(d => d.Type === "Something")
})

```

***Tips:*** 

When you use this method to import data:

* Data can be in public folder
* Data can even be an URL
* You can mutate the data inside of .then() however you want

## Svelte's Synchronous Way: onMount()

What if your data is on a server and it takes some time to load it. Well, we can get some help from our old friend, d3.js.

1. **Import d3.csv**

   ```javascript
   import { csv } from "d3"
   ```

2. **Import data asynchronously**

   Here is what I used to do while just using d3.js.

   ```javascript
   let dataset = [];
   
   async () => {
   	dataset = await d3.csv('link_or_path_of_dataset'). 
     // d3.csv returns a promise. await "pauses" the execution untill the promise resolves
   }
   ```

   Svelte actually made the asynchronous way easier to understand.

3. **Put the function above inside onMount**

   onMount is a Svelte special. You need to import it from Svelte first.

   ```javascript
   import { onMount } from "svelte";
   ```
   Then put the async function above inside Svelte.
   
   ```javascript
   let dataset = [];
   
   onMount(
   	async () => {
   		dataset = await d3.csv('link_or_path_of_dataset').  // you can use fetch() here, totally up to you
   	}
   )
   
   $: console.log(dataset)
   ```

   Now you can access the data even at the top level too.

   So the chunk above is basically saying:

   " Ok, everyone outside of me(onMount). Keep going. I will catch up with you once you are all 'mounted'"

   When other code finishes running, functions within onMount get called. You will change the dataset variable you defined before, and then Svelte's reactivity will happliy change other variables of interest. 

   In this case, onMount will return you a fulfilled promise. 

***Tips***: 

   * Do not define the dataset variable inside onMount. It would be scoped in onMount so that you can't refer to it outside of onMount function.
   * Whatever is inside of onMount will be run once the rest of your code is run, aka "the component is first rendered to the DOM", aka after elements are "mounted".(Or I think of it as: the code your wrote in your .svlete file completes running for the first time.)

### Bonus: common measure people adpot with data in hands: Context and Store

So your `Chart.svelte` component will not be a lonely island. It passes data down to its child componenets to create more stuff, like axis, legend, circles, on the web page. **To facilitate this "passing-data" process**, Svelte offers you **Context** and **Store**. Those two are basically objects where you store your data and expect Svelte to perform the miracle.

I will show you how you can use **Context** and **Store** to pass data and explain how you will benefit from **Context** and **Store**.

***Ignore all Tips section if you find it discontinous to read everything all at once. You can still get the desired result without reading Tips***

1. **Save data in a Store**

   ```javascript
   import { writable } from "svelte"
   
   const data = writable([])
   // const dimensions = writable({});
   // const scales = writable({});
   ```

   **Store** is just an object, nothing more. `writable()` basically claims that here is a **Store**(again, just an object, don't fear), which you can access and modify. At first, its value is an empty array as we defined, but it can be a string"", an object{} or a number(0). You will overwrite it anyway later.

   When `onMount` returns the dataset, I want to store the dataset in the data **Store** we defined earlier.

   ```javascript
   $: data.set(dataset)
   ```

   .set is what you use to assign values to a **Store**. The code re-runs when dataset is changed. Therefore, I can reactively pass my dataset to a **Store**.

   **Tips:**

   * **I have got my data already. Why do I need to learn store and even use it? ?**

     I have had this confusion. 

     Svelte stores provide an easy way to share data between components regardless of their relationship in the component hierarchy.

     * If your store is supposed to be global, then exporting it from a module file is the way to go

     * If it is local to a component, then just create it in the component.
     
     * If it is supposed to be distributed in the context of a tree of components, then `setContext` is the answer
     
     // check Lihau's video about store
     
     // check page 148. of
     
   * **Store** is reactive. Context is not. When changing the data or load the data asynchronously, we should be doing ok

   * Note that the **Store**  must be declared at the top level of the component

2. **Save Store in a Context**

   To save **Store** in **Context**, you need to create a context, so you use `setContext`(Yeah, very straightforward, I know). A key parameter and an object are all the function needs.

   ```javascript
   // This is in Chart.svelte
   import { setContext } from "svelte"
   import { writable } from "svelte"
   
   const data = writable([])
   $: data.set(dataset)
   
   // 2. save store in a context
   // not often practiced
   // $: setContext("Chart", data);
   
   // do this if you have multiple stores
   //$: chartContext = { dimensions, scales, data, names }; define more and you can pass more
   $: chartContext = { data }
   $: setContext("Chart", chartContext);
   ```

   At this time, there is a **Context** whose `key` is "Chart" in our current component.

   Watch, magic happens now.

   **Tips:**

   * **Why save Store(s) in Context but not just use Store?**

     * When there are multiple **Stores**, using **Context** make data more managable and reusable. Save **Store** in an object is a good practice. In real case scenario, you probably want to pass more than just data **Store** into **Context**. 

       ```javascript
       // Chart.svelte
       import { setContext } from "svelte"
       import { writable } from "svelte"
       
       const data = writable([])
       const dimensions = writable([])
       const scales = writable([])
       
       $: data.set(dataset)
       $: dimensions.set()
       $: scales.set()
       
       // all stores in one. managable
       $: chartContext = { data, dimensions, scales }
       $: setContext("Chart", chartContext);
       ```

       ```javascript
       // Child.svelte
       import { getContext } from "svelte"
       
       const { data, scales } = getContext('Chart')
       ```

       ```javascript
       // Child_of_Child.svelte
       import { getContext } from "svelte"
       
       const { data, scales } = getContext('Chart')
       ```

   * You are not updating the data inside **context**. We just told Svelte to re-run the line when chartContext, an object of stores, changes.

   * **Context** should not be defined inside any functions or scope and not even in asynchronous functions. Top-level is its safe place.(here is not accurate)

3. **Access data in any Child component of your current component**

   (As long as you import components into your current component, those imported components are called **child components** of your current component.)

   ```javascript
   // This is in Child.svelte 
   import { getContext } from "svelte";
   
   // Object desturcturing
   const { data } = getContext("Chart");
   $: console.log($data)
   
   // if you want to rename the data, feel free to use your object/array destructuring here
   //const { data: anything } = getContext("Chart");
   //$: console.log(anything)
   ```

   DONE!

   Remember your wrote the code below in `Chart.svelte`?

   ```javascript
   $: chartContext = { data }
   $: setContext("Chart", chartContext);
   ```

   In `Child.svelte`, you can use `getContext` (again, very straightforward name, I know) to get the **Context** defined in parent component, `Chart.svelte`, by passing the `key` parameter defined earlier——`getContext('Chart')`!

   Think `getContext` as a phone children give to the parent(papa) component and key as the phone number. Child components, only child components, can call parent to get the data(scales or dimensions or money if you resonate with this metaphor a lot...) 

   **BUT!** You saved data **Store** in an object. What you actually passed to the **Context** is an object named **chartContext**. 

   Em...**How do we extract data from an object?**

   BINGO! Object destructuring.
   
   ```javascript
   const { data } = getContext("Chart");
   $: console.log($data)
   ```
   
   Now you can communicate your data with all components happily ever after.
   
   **Tips:**
   
   * `$`  before **Store** is just how Svelte gets the value inside a **Store**.  If you want to know more about store and auto-subscription($), please visit the Svelte's website. Assignments to `$`-prefixed variables require that the variable be a writable store
   * The key parameter can be a variety of things. We are using string here. Please refer to Svelte tutorial for more details.
